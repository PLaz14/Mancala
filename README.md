# Mancala and Q-Learning with Q-Tables

> **Preliminary Research and Coding with Bellman Equation and Q-Tables**

`rungame.py` is an introductory game that I developed using pygame. The object of this mini-project is to get the ball to "learn" how to run laps around the track that I call a "maze" (I know it looks nothing like a maze, but in the future I would like to introduce more introcut mazes). I use linear algebra to find the distance between the ball and each of the walls in the north, east, west, northeast, and northwest cardinal directions. These are my input parameters for my Q-Table, and the parameters of which the ball will learn to travel around the "maze." `rungame.py` is located in the `testing` folder.
